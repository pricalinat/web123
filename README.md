### A platform build in django for hosting CTF events. 

#### Live demo 

[https://xyz-minictf.herokuapp.com/](https://xyz-minictf.herokuapp.com/)

#### Test it locally

Here in this branch I added my own database which I used in the development process. Therefore admin and other users are already there with some challenges to test. Below are the few credentials to use.

```

###### Install miniCTF

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/DivyanshuSahu/miniCTF.git
$ git checkout local
$ python manage.py runserver
```

Then use above credentials to log in.
